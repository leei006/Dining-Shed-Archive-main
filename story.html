            <h2>More To The Story</h2>
            <p>Mayor Eric Adams opened applications for city restaurants to apply for and participate in Dining Out NYC—the city’s permanent outdoor dining program. The online application portal will serve as an access point for restaurants to apply to participate in the program. The following infographics are samples of blueprints for future outdoor dining sheds.</p>
            <h3>Plans For The Future</h3>
            <img id="plans" src="plans/Corner Roadway Setup.png" alt="">
            <p>The corner setup showcased includes an aluminum barrier with marine plywood sheathing, an aluminum floor structure with wood paver infills, an overhead covering with wood posts and a fabric canopy, string lighting overhead, rechargeable table lights, a small storage bench, and removable panels.</p>
            <img id="plans" src="plans/Mid-Block Roadway Setup.png" alt="">
            <p>The mid-block setup showcased includes an aluminum barrier with marine plywood sheathing, an aluminum floor structure, a rigid overhead canopy made with aluminum and rigid polycarbonate panels, an electrical connection to the restaurant to support a fan, table lights, screening wood slats panels, and integrated bench seating to save space.</p>
            <img id="plans" src="plans/Roadway Setup.png" alt="">
            <p>The floating parking lane setup showcased includes a barrier with marine plywood cladding; an aluminum floor structure with marine plywood tiles and a removable, rubber accessibility ramp; a rigid overhead canopy made of aluminum and vestibule panel covering; planters for greenery throughout; a guard made of vestibule panels; and chain link enclosure.</p>
            <img id="plans" src="plans/Steep Street Roadway.png" alt="">
            <p>The steep street setup showcased includes an aluminum barrier with sheet metal cladding, a perforated square steel tubing floor structure with floorboards, a metal accessibility ramp and steps, an overhead canopy with an aluminum structure and retractable fabric, battery-operated table lights, planters for greenery, and integrated bench seating to save space.</p>

<h2>The Right to Dine</h2>
        <div id="right">
            <h2>1</h2><p>If restaurants are identified as a known cause for contributing to the spread of the virus, and those who embrace the risk of dining out to experience a taste 
                of normalcy are tagged as contributors to the spread of the virus, it should come as no surprise that an industry largely funded by “labor[s] of love” feels strained by a lack of long-term economic support. </p>
            </div>
        <div id="right">
            <h2>2</h2><p>The predicament imposed by the pandemic in Paris is not perfect, but 
                    the appreciation of culture-of pre
                    serving the aesthetic for its intellectual and psychological benefits-does not have to be taught. It is inherent in their social values. The vision of the industry 
                    as a beneficiary of affirmative action 
                    is rooted in an understanding of the intangible benefits that food provides. </p>
                </div>
        <div id="right">
            <h2>3</h2><p>Restaurants are a “fundamental social glue” in both their function as a democratized urban amenity, as well as source of social engagement.155 The unique qualities of a place like NYC have transformed the restaurant business into a business unlike any other in the world… operating a restaurant in NYC requires a special level of passion and tenacity not needed anywhere else in the U.S.</p>
                    </div>
        <div id="right">
            <h2>4</h2><p>The French model of economic relief serves as an ideal model for government assistance to be provided in response to financial hardships caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The cultural devotion to workers’ needs captures  the benefits of having a system of governance that views the needs of its citizens as synonymous with the needs of the state. </p>
        </div>
        <div id="right">
            <h2>5</h2><p>The point is: food law ought to take account of dining culture. The largely aesthetic importance of having a flourishing restaurant scene is deeper than the superficial qualities of passing time gorging on edible delicacies in the company of others. Perhaps the pulpit of a barstool is the proper model for addressing this failure to understand the crucial role of restaurant culture.</p>

       <p id="orange">“...These places are more than a mere spot in which to eat – they have trans-formed our sidewalks and streets into vibrant places that people want to be, places where friends and neighbors gather to laugh, talk, and enjoy life. They have become magnetic destinations because of how valued they are and how they bring us together.”

    <p id="orange">“The sidewalk café in New York is genius. From the speakeasy
